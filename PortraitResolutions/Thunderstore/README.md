# PortraitResolutions Mod
I made this mod as I have a portrait monitor and DSP was being painfully insistent on running in monitor-native resolutions alone (which is tied to the monitor orientation \*sigh\*)  
This mod allows DSP to also support portrait orientations when the monitor is in landscape mode and landscape orientations when the monitor is in portrait mode

## How to use this mod
* First install the mod, and reboot the game.
* Go to settings and choose the video resolution you want.

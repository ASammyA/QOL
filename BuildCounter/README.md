# BuildCounter

With this mod installed your cursor will show the amount of items being used by the current build order.  

Fully compatible with [CopyInserter](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/thisisbrad/CopyInserters/), [MultiBuild](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/brokenmass/MultiBuild)/[MultiDestruct](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/brokenmass/MultiDestruct) and [AdvancedBuildDestruct](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/xiaoye97/AdvancedBuildDestruct/) (ad probably most of the mods out there).

## Disclaimer

**This mod does not alter any entity or save anything to disk.**  
This mean the mod SHOULD be very safe to use and not break your savegame, not even after an update.  
If it stops working following a game update, you can just disable it and your game will just work, obviously without the extended capabilities provided by the mod.

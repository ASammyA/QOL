# RailgunsRetargeting

With this mod installed your railguns will try to target an alternative orbit if the configured one is not reachable.

## Configuration

The speed up is configurable (you must start the game at least once for the configuration file to be created) using the following parameters:

### ignoreOrbit1
> Should the auto retargeting ignore the default, undeletable orbit 1 ?
- `Default value : false (allow retargeting to orbit1)`

## Changelog

### v1.2.0
- Add configuration option to disable retargeting to default, undeletable, `orbit 1`

### v1.1.0
- Ensure the originally selected orbit (and not the retargeted one) is stored at save time
- Improve visual style in railgun configuration panel

### v1.0.1
- Initial Release
